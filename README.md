# Easy Mobx Intro - Starter Template 

<p align="center"><br><img src="public/react-native-UX-design.gif" alt="drawing" width="300px"/><br><br></p>

A *fresh out of the oven* template based on this [tutorial](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html) but with some added goodies:

  - A `package.json` file with Babel 7, React 16 and Mobx 5 preconfigured
  - A working React example of `@observer`, `@observable`, `@computed` properties and class references
  - A `jsconfig.json` file to disable ES6 decorator warnings 

Clone this rep and use the following commands: 

```
  npm install
  npm run start 
```

Enjoy!
