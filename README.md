#### Easy Mobx Intro - Starter Template (truly 10 mins)

A repository for https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html (with some added goodies)

This package includes:

  - A package.json file with Babel 7, React 16 and Mobx 5 preconfigured
  - A working React example of @observer, @observable, @computed properties and class references

Clone this rep and use the following commands:
